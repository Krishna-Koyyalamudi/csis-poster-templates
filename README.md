# Poster Templates

This repository contains some simple research poster templates for Microsoft PowerPoint.

To import and use the templates in powerpoint (for multiple posters, perhaps, or to modify the theme to your liking) follow the directions [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/apply-a-template-to-a-new-presentation-d3d4ece5-e965-45eb-9423-c34e61b34616#officeversion=2016,_2013)

To create a single poster using one of the templates, make a copy of the .pptx you would like to use and modify the template to fit your project.

When using these templates you should remove boxes that are not helpful to you, and you can always create new content areas on the slides.  Feel free to personalize these templates to your liking; choosing colors or additional styles that are appropriate to your project and building a unique poster is an excellent experience that can make your work stand out.

## File types

.potx files are the PowerPoint template file; you can import that into PowerPoint if you desire (or plan to make a lot of posters using the same template).

.pptx files are a single slide that you can modify with the content for your poster and save as a new file.
