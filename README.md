# Poster Templates

This repository contains some simple research poster templates for Microsoft PowerPoint.

To import and use the templates in powerpoint (for multiple posters, perhaps, or to modify the theme to your liking) follow the directions at https://support.office.com/en-us/article/apply-a-template-to-a-new-presentation-d3d4ece5-e965-45eb-9423-c34e61b34616#officeversion=2016,_2013

To create a single poster using one of the templates, make a copy of the .pptx you would like to use and modify the template to fit your project.
